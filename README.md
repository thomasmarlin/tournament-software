# Star Wars CCG Tournament Assistant
Welcome to the Star Wars CCG Tournament Assistant for Star Wars CCG! 

Running large SWCCG tournaments can be very complex and time consuming. This tool takes the load off of the tournament directory by:
- Automatically Pairings of Players
- Handling all of the SOS Calculations
- Saving tournament results (either locally in your browser OR on the SWCCG Website)

For more information about Star Wars CCG, check out the SWCCG Players Committee website here: https://www.starwarsccg.org/
